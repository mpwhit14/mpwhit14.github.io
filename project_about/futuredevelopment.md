##Possibilites for future development

- where can this project go?
- what can be done with the RDF graph?
- how can someone add to or implement the graph in a different way?

Currently, the graph consists of images of inscriptions, grammatical topics and larger concepts, digital editions of each inscription, and characters and locations related to each inscription.  I am choosing to access the graph from a grammatical standpoint, that is, I am using images that clearly illustrate grammatical topics for the purpose of teaching those grammatical topics.  However, it is possible to look at this information in a variety of ways.  For example, one could do a study on a particular character or location, or one could take an archaeological perspective and work on inscriptions with historical significance.  As it stands now, much of the material is untranslated and filled with not immediately discernable abbreviations - one could easily find those gaps and try to fill them.

In order to improve upon the material and develop the project further, I would like to see the following:
- Pleiades references added to the location data
- Unknown abbreviations deciphered
- Grammatical concepts expanded to include complicated structures, like subordinate clauses
- Translations
- Additional information about the inscriptions added
