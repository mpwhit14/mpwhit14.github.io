	<p>It is my goal with this project to create a resource for students and teachers of Latin epigraphy to bring Latin inscriptions into the classroom.  The benefits of using primary sources in the classroom are well-known, and Latin inscriptions, by nature formulaic, are accessible to students even in their first year of Latin.  Therefore, we have put together a collection of inscriptions aimed for classroom use.  This collection of photographs, which I took during my junior year abroad (2012-2013), is linked to grammatical, geographic, and prosopographic data, among other things.  As a result, the collection is sortable, searchable, and most importantly, adaptable to the needs of a curriculum.</p>
