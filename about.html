	<p>It is my goal with this project to create a resource for students 
	and teachers of Latin epigraphy to bring Latin inscriptions into the 
	classroom.  The benefits of using primary sources in the classroom 
	are well-known, and Latin inscriptions, by nature formulaic, are 
	accessible to students even in their first year of Latin.  Therefore, 
	we have put together a collection of inscriptions aimed for classroom 
	use.  This collection of photographs, which I took during my junior 
	year abroad (2012-2013), is linked to grammatical, geographic, and 
	prosopographic data, among other things.  As a result, the collection 
	is sortable, searchable, and most importantly, adaptable to the needs 
	of a curriculum.</p>
